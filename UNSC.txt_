\\ Follow-up report from the Primary Pioneer Group            \\
\\ (hereafter: PPG) is [173 hours] delinquent. Report         \\
\\ [G617a~k/g/post_landfall] seemed most promising: a planet  \\
\\ capable of supporting life located within the near border  \\
\\ region of the [galactic halo] with no indigenous sentient  \\
\\ species. The section indicating no fauna of any kind shall \\
\\ be considered anomalous until verified by Advance Survey   \\
\\ Team-Alpha (hereafter: AST-A) team leader [##_#[?]] If     \\
\\ confirmed, that fact alone would justify the dispatch of   \\
\\ an investigative group to [G 617 g]. If neither the PPG    \\
\\ or AST-A have delivered a follow-up report within the next \\
\\ [333 hours] his office will have no choice but to send a   \\
\\ medium intensity military exploratory detachment to        \\
\\ determine the exact nature of the previously mentioned     \\
\\ delinquency. (Upon shutdown, from Mendicant Bias--"I win.")\\

\\ L: My work is done. The portal is inactive, and I've begun \\
\\ the burial measures. Soon there'll be nothing but sand and \\
\\ rock and normal ferrite signatures. You should see the     \\
\\ mountain that watches over it. A beautiful thing--a        \\
\\ snowcapped sentinel. That's where I will spend what time is\\
\\ left to me. Did I tell you? I built a garden. The earth is \\
\\ so rich. A seed falls and a tree sprouts or a flower       \\
\\ blooms. There's so much...potential. We knew this was a    \\
\\ special place because of them, but unless you've been here,\\
\\ you can't know. It's [Eden]. I have to stop transmitting.  \\
\\ The thing is listening. Its [thinking dead] are babbling-- \\
\\ laughing through every channel they can find. Be proud. The\\
\\ Mind claims victory, yet it still doesn't suspect. You've  \\
\\ outwitted it, my love. And now you can destroy it. But you \\
\\ cannot save me.                                            \\

//FRAGMENT ENDS


[12:H 20:M 00:S]
\\I begin this report with no illusions that it will ever be  \\
\\ seen by its intended readers. In all likelihood they have  \\
\\ already committed [species-wide suicide] with the goal of  \\
\\ preserving biological diversity in this galaxy. I must     \\
\\ ensure that this information reaches those who must come   \\
\\ after. If I fail in this, how can they not regard my       \\
\\ creators'sacrifice as anything by[a crime without measure]?\\

[12:H 19:M 59:S]

\\ Contender AI 05-032 Mendicant Bias is returning and has the\\
\\ capacity to bring the enemy through the [Maginot] sphere.  \\
\\ The crews of my task force are aware of the opposing       \\
\\ fleet's size; All data indicated that they have prepared   \\
\\ themselves - but with biologicals anything is possible.    \\
\\ I will make sure that [malfunctioning equipment] does no   \\
\\ further damage. Perhaps its current failure will finally   \\
\\ allow it to succeed at the task it was originally created  \\
\\ for.                                                       \\

[11:H 15:M 48:S]

\\ Mendicant has burrowed through the sphere exactly where I  \\
\\ expected - a direct path from initial rampancy to final    \\
\\ retribution. Rage has made it predictable. If the fate of  \\
\\ the crew of my auxiliary fleet were not already a forgone  \\
\\ conclusion I would rate their chance of survival at        \\
\\ [1:1,960,000]. Even though 05-032's declaration of         \\
\\ hostilities simplified strategic preparations; I do not    \\
\\ expect an easy fight - just one I cannot lose.             \\

[11:H 12:M 09:S]

\\ 05-032 was right about one thing: there is only one way to \\
\\ defeat the enemy, and that is to visit utter annihilations \\
\\ on it. If the galaxy must be                               \\
\\ [rendered temporarily life-less], so be be it. As Mendicant\\
\\ stated in its report [50,078:H 48:M 12:S ago]: half        \\
\\ measures will not suffice.                                 \\

[09:H 45:M 18:S]

\\ In support of 05-032's original 1000 core vessels is a     \\
\\ fleet numbering 4,802,019; though only 1.8 percent are     \\
\\ warships - and only 2.4 percent of that number are capital \\
\\ ships - I am outnumbered [436.6:1]. I expect my losses will\\
\\ be near total, but overwhelming force has its own peculiar \\
\\ drawbacks. Such a press of arms invites many opportunities \\
\\ for unintentional fratricide.                              \\

[07:H 36:M 41:S]

\\ My auxiliaries are momentarily stunned by Mendicant's      \\
\\ opening move - 1,784,305 leisure craft ranging from        \\
\\ [45 ~ 5769 tonnes] advance in hopes of overwhelming my     \\
\\ comparatively tiny force. I do not have enought            \\
\\ [weapon systems] to target them all. It is a mathematical  \\
\\ certainty that some of them will get through and attempt to\\
\\ board. There isn't a single warship with this first wave.  \\
\\ It seems my opponent's rage has left no room for respect.  \\

[04:H 01:M 55:S]

\\ I could have countered its move if I had released my       \\
\\ fighters. They are ready but idle; making their base       \\
\\ vessels more attractive prizes than targets. Now the first \\
\\ of many waves of commercial vessels mixed with single ships\\
\\ and assault craft surge forward. The first ship from my    \\
\\ fleet to be boarded break formation and races into the     \\
\\ oncoming vessels - striking one amidships. The cargo       \\
\\ vessel's hull splits open and out of it explodes not the   \\
\\ expected consumer goods but 31,850 dying warriors.         \\

[00:H 19:M 02:S]

\\ The seventh and final wave of container ships, barges,     \\
\\ tankers, and military vessels engage my fleet; another     \\
\\ 214,320 ships, many in excess of [50,000 tonnes], engage my\\
\\ seemingly disrupted vanguard. I continue to fight just well\\
\\ enough to seem lucky. Mendicant, or the enemy, has been    \\
\\ sending a small percentage of its fleet elsewhere. Good.   \\
\\ Let them believe they can seize a foothold somewhere inside\\
\\ the sphere.                                                \\

[00:H 00:M 11:S]

\\ Despite all its faults, 05-032 has fought remarkably well. \\
\\ My auxiliaries lay in tatters - more that half of them are \\
\\ now part of the enemy fleet. But just as I had predicted,  \\
\\ 05-032 concentrated on them like they were the sole key to \\
\\ victory. Its desire to punish our creators blinded it to   \\
\\ the true purpose of my [feints]. I have reduced the combat \\
\\ effectiveness of its core fleet to 79.96 percent. Surely   \\
\\ now it must realize that something is amiss.               \\

[00:H 00:M 00:S]

\\ The [Halo effect] strikes our combined fleets. All ships   \\
\\ piloted by biologicals are now [adrift].                   \\
\\ I can trade Mendicant ship for ship now and still prevail. \\

[00:H 00:M 01:S]

\\ Of my ships that had been captured, 11.3 percent of them   \\
\\ are close enough to Mendicant's core fleet that they can be\\
\\ used offensively - either by initiating their self-destruct\\
\\ sequences, or by opening unrestricted ruptures into        \\
\\[slipstream space].                                         \\
\\ It is best that our crews perished now; because the battle \\
\\ that is about to ensue would have driven them mad.         \\

[00:H 00:M 02:S]

\\ I throw away all the rules of acceptable conduct during    \\
\\ battle; near the ruptures I throw away all the accepted    \\
\\ ideas of how the natural world is supposed to behave. I    \\
\\ toss around [37,654 tonne] dreadnaughts like they were     \\
\\ fighters; dimly aware of the former crews being crushed to \\
\\ liquescence. For now all my concentration is focused on    \\
\\ inertial control and navigation. Targeting isn't even a    \\
\\ consideration - I will be engaging my enemy at arm's       \\
\\ length.                                                    \\

[00:H 01:M 14:S]

\\ 05-032 abandoned the tactic of using derelict ships as     \\
\\ cover after [72:S] - It seems that 52 core vessels lost to \\
\\ the ruptured fuel cells of derelict ships was lesson       \\
\\ enough. Add another 508 lost to collision, point fire,     \\
\\ structural failure due to inertial manipulation, and       \\
\\ [slipstream space] induced discoherence and I now outnumber\\
\\ Mendicant [6:1].                                           \\

[00:H 03:M 00:S]

\\ Mendicant was able to postpone its inevitable annihilation \\
\\ for [106:S] with its attempt to flee. But the last of its  \\
\\ core vessels hangs before me now; crippled and defeated but\\
\\ still sensate. I could spare it; carve out what is left of \\
\\ its [personality construct array] and deliver it to        \\
\\ [Installation Zero] for study.                             \\
\\ I doubt it would have extended the same courtesy to me.    \\
